It uses Cloudinary in a very rudimentary way to upload images whose URLs are stored in the MongoDB Atlas database. Fronted image processing is used to ensure that any image upload to Cloudinary is at the maximum resolution that the image might be needed, i.e. avatar images have a maximum height of 40px. Feed images are dynamically reduced to a maximum intrinsic width of 400px suitable for the dynamic column width used. Logged in users are able to upload their own images, make comments, like photos and delete their own photos.",

The core of the app is a Vite React frontend and calls to the MongoDB database are made through the custom API using Node.js and Express. The app also uses JWT token for sessions and all passwords are salted and hashed using BCrypt. There is an addional test suite for this app with a comprehensive set of end to end tests in Java & Selenium using a Page Object Model with highly modular functions",

Following a spree of independent code exploration and extension, I took some of the skills I had gathered and decided to rebuild the app from scratch but it required a lot of extra learning and experimentation to get it to work.
