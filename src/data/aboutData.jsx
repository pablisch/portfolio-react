        I was privileged to have the amazing oportunity of sending a Raspberry Pi computer to the edge of space attached to a high-altitude balloon as a primary school anniversary celebration project. The payload included a range of cameras programmed in python to record a mix of video and images and send live images back to Earth, a GPS unit to track the journey and transmitter to send back live telemetry of the flight.
